Compare two project assessments side-by-side. This command requires two ASSESSMENT.md files as input.

Usage: /compare $ASSESSMENT_A $ASSESSMENT_B

If file paths are not provided as arguments, check for:
1. ASSESSMENT.md in the current directory
2. Ask the user to provide paths to two assessment files

## Comparison Process

### 1. Extract Scores
Pull the scoring table from each assessment. Build a side-by-side comparison:

| Dimension | Weight | Project A | Project B | Delta | Advantage |
|-----------|--------|-----------|-----------|-------|-----------|
| Problem-solution fit | 3x | | | | |
| Security posture | 2x | | | | |
| Implementation completeness | 2x | | | | |
| Tech stack modernity | 1.5x | | | | |
| Code quality | 1.5x | | | | |
| Innovation / differentiation | 1x | | | | |
| **Weighted Composite** | | | | | |

### 2. Tech Stack Comparison
| Aspect | Project A | Project B | Notes |
|--------|-----------|-----------|-------|
| Language | | | |
| Framework | | | |
| Database | | | |
| Hosting | | | |
| Testing | | | |
| CI/CD | | | |

### 3. Architecture Comparison
For each project, summarize:
- Top 2 architectural strengths
- Top 2 architectural concerns
- Scalability ceiling

### 4. Competitive Overlap
- Do they compete in the same space?
- Shared alternatives from market research
- Unique positioning of each

### 5. Verdict
Based on the comparison, provide:
- **Best for [use case A]**: Project X, because...
- **Best for [use case B]**: Project Y, because...
- **Overall recommendation**: If forced to pick one, which and why?
- **Caveats**: What context would change this recommendation?
